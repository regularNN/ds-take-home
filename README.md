# Take-Home Assignment for Senior Data Scientist

## Objective:

Develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict relevant categories for each document in the dataset.

### Dataset Description:

- Collection of over 10K articles from a news service, partitioned into training and test sets. 
- Each article belongs to one or more categories (there are 90 categories overall). 

## Tasks:

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

- Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset's features and labels.
- Implement suitable feature engineering and preprocessing techniques.

### 2. Model Development:

- Build a classification model to predict all categories associated with an article, using an algorithm(s) of your choice.
- Provide a rationale for your choice of model and any hyperparameter tuning process.
- Address challenges specific to your approach.

### 3. Model Evaluation:

- Evaluate the model using relevant metrics.
- Analyze the performance across different labels and discuss any discrepancies observed.

### 4. (Optional) Advanced Analysis:

- Explore a second approach, and discuss the trade-offs or benefits compared to your original approach.

### 5. Deliverables:

- Submit a well-documented Jupyter Notebook or equivalent, with clear code, comments, and analysis.
- Describe your approach, findings, and potential improvements or future work.
- (Optional) Create a short presentation (5-6 slides) to summarize your findings.
